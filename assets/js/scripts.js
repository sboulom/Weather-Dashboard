//Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.
// Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.
// Your app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
// Display the following under current weather conditions:
// City
// Date
// Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
// Temperature
// Humidity
// Wind speed
// UV index
// Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.
// Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:
// Date
// Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
// Temperature
// Humidity
// !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-------HINTS-----------!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
// Create multiple functions within your application to handle the different parts of the dashboard:
// Current conditions
// 5-Day Forecast
// Search history
// UV index
// You will need to make more than one AJAX call.
// You will need to hardcode some of the parameters in the API's URL. User input will determine some of the other parameters.
// Use localStorage to store any persistent data.
